# pixy-spark-core-rover
Getting the pixy CMUcam5 from Charmed labs http://charmedlabs.com/default/products/  working on a spark core rover



This rover has two motor drivers, one cheap and one expensive, so you may have to change the code a little bit to work with your motor driver.

Copy the pixy-rover.ino file to your spark IDE. Save.
click + in the top right corner and copy Pixy.h to the IDE. Save
click + again and copy TPixy.h to the IDE. Save

Flash the code to your core.



Sorry. I only just learnt how to make a proper Spark.io library file and I have not done that yet.
